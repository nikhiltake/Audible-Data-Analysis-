This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing an Audible dataset using Power Query Editor in Excel. The dataset was refined to ensure consistency, accuracy, and proper formatting for analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Key Data Cleaning Tasks:

âœ” Standardized Name Column â€“ Applied title casing for uniformity.

âœ” Separated Author Names â€“ Extracted first and last names using a delimiter.

âœ” Formatted Release Date â€“ Ensured DD-MM-YYYY format using a formula.

âœ” Converted Time to Duration Format â€“ Transformed audiobook durations into an Excel-recognized format.

âœ” Validated Price Column â€“ Converted to numeric format and identified non-numeric values.

âœ” Transformed Ratings â€“ Converted text ratings (e.g., "5 out of 5 stars") to numeric values.

âœ” Split Narrator Column â€“ Divided multiple narrators into separate columns.

âœ” Merged Release Date & Language â€“ Created a new column releaseinfo in "DD-MM-YYYY, Language" format.

âœ” Formatted Currency Values â€“ Ensured all prices are displayed with two decimal places.
